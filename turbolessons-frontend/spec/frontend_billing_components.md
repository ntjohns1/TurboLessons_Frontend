    - Prioritize and implement any necessary changes or improvements.

#### 5. Final Review and Deployment

**Duration**: 1 week

1. **Code Review and Quality Assurance**:
    - Conduct thorough code reviews to ensure code quality and adherence to standards.
    - Perform final QA testing to catch any remaining issues.

2. **Prepare for Deployment**:
    - Ensure that all necessary environment variables and configurations are set for production.
    - Build the application for production using the appropriate build command (e.g., `npm run build`).

3. **Deploy to Production**:
    - Deploy the application to the chosen hosting service (e.g., Vercel, Netlify, AWS Amplify).
    - Monitor the deployment for any issues and resolve them promptly.

#### 6. Post-Deployment Monitoring and Maintenance

**Duration**: Ongoing

1. **Monitor Application Performance**:
    - Use monitoring tools like Google Analytics and Sentry to track application performance and errors.
    - Monitor key metrics such as page load times, API response times, and error rates.

2. **Gather User Feedback**:
